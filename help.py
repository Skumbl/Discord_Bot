roll = """

The `roll` command allows you to roll any dice expression. You can input a roll expression, such as `4d6+2`, and the bot will roll the dice and provide the result.

### Accepted Syntax
To use the `roll` command, use the following syntax:

/roll [expression]
/roll [expression, expression]

- `expression`: The roll expression you want to evaluate. It can contain various dice rolls and modifiers.

**Note: ** expressions are written in standard dice notation supporting advanced features like exploding dice, keeping higher or lower values, and nested expressions

### Examples
/roll [1d20]
- rolls a d20

/roll [1d20 + 2]
- rolls a d20 adds 2

/roll [2d6 - 2]
- rolls a d20 subtracts 2

/roll [2d20kh1]
- rolls 2d20 and returns the higher dice

/roll [2d6+3, 3d8, 1d20-2]
- rolls all 3 dice expressions separably from each other 

### Usage
You can use this command to simulate dice rolls for various tabletop role-playing games and other scenarios where random numbers are needed.

### Result Format
The command will provide the result in the following format:

:game_die: = [result]
[expression] = [roll_result]

- `[result]`: The final result of the dice roll.
- `[expression]`: The roll expression you provided.
- `[roll_result]`: The individual rolls and modifiers applied to calculate the result.

### Example Result
:game_die: = 15
2d6+3 = 4+6+3+2 = 15

This indicates a roll of 15 for the expression `2d6+3`.

**Note:** If you provide an invalid roll expression, the bot will respond with an error message.

**Example Error Response:**

invalid input: "Invalid expression"
"""

percent = """

The `percentile` command allows you to roll a 2 percentile die. This command simulates rolling two 10-sided dice (2d10) and adding an optional modifier to the result.

### Accepted Syntax
To use the `percentile` command, use the following syntax

/percentile [modifier]

- `[modifier]` (Optional): You can provide an optional modifier that will be added to the roll result. If not provided, the default modifier is `0`.

**Note:** the modifier also allows for the adding of additional rolls to the modifier

### Example
/percentile [10]
-rolls 2 percentile die with a modifier of +10.

/percentile [1d4+2]
-rolls 2 percentile die with a modifier of +1d4 and +2

### Usage
You can use this command to generate random percentage values for various purposes. The result will be within the valid percentage range of 0% to 100%.

### Result Format
The command will provide the result in the following format:

:game_die: = [result]%
2d10([tens_roll], [ones_roll]) + [modifier]

- `[result]`: The final percentage result.
- `[tens_roll]` and `[ones_roll]`: The individual rolls of the 2d10.
- `[modifier]`: The modifier added to the roll.

### Example Result
:game_die: = 75%
2d10(40, 5) + 30

This indicates a roll of 75% (40 + 5 + 30).

**Note:** If you provide an invalid modifier, the bot will handle it gracefully and provide the result accordingly.
